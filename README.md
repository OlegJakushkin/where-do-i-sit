## About
[![](https://zisest.ru/files/where-do-i-sit.gif)](https://trains.zisest.ru/)

The goal of the project is to develop a system that would keep track of occupied seats in suburban trains. Data from pressure sensors under the seats would be sent to a hub on the train and then to a remote server via GSM.

Potentially, commuters will have the ability to choose which of the arriving trains to take based on how busy it is. Additionally, it would let passenger know which car has more free seats and help them find where to sit.
